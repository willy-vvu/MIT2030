# MIT 2030

MIT 2030 is my vision for a fictional future dorm in a speculative MIT, embodying a refreshed set of values that I wish the present MIT had: more focus on creativity and the arts and a bustling cross-disciplinary community. Focusing less on design technicalities and more on intellectual provocation, I chose a general timeframe of 15 years in order to account for organizational changes, funding and licensing, design and construction, and so on. I was driven by questions in the form "what if?": What if MIT were modern, daring, and agile? What if MIT were founded today? *What would it look like?*
